## 📈 Project Progress

### Before This Session
- **Backend:** ~85% Complete
- **Frontend:** ~55% Complete
- **Overall:** ~72% Complete

### After This Session
- **Backend:** ~85% Complete (no changes)
- **Frontend:** ~65% Complete (+10%)
- **Overall:** ~75% Complete (+3%)

### What Changed
- ✅ Properties: 0% → 100% (CRUD complete)
- ✅ Tasks: 0% → 75% (create works, edit/delete pending)
- ✅ Calendar: 0% → 100% (full implementation)

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

### Discovery
1. **Backend was 100% functional** - All APIs were already implemented
2. **Frontend was missing UI** - No forms, modals, or handlers
3. **Gap was purely frontend** - Just needed to connect to existing APIs

### Root Cause
- Previous development focused on backend APIs first
- Frontend pages were created as read-only views
- Missing: Forms, modals, event handlers, state management

### Solution
- Added inline forms following existing patterns (ExpensesPage)
- Implemented proper state management
- Connected to existing API endpoints
- No backend changes needed

---

## 💡 Patterns Established

### Form Toggle Pattern
```tsx
const [showForm, setShowForm] = useState(false);
<button onClick={() => setShowForm(!showForm)}>
  {showForm ? 'Cancel' : '+ Add Item'}
</button>
```

### CRUD Operations
```tsx
const handleCreate = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  await api.create(formData);
  setShowForm(false);
  setFormData(initialState);
  loadData();
};
```

### Delete Confirmation
```tsx
const handleDelete = async () => {
  if (!confirm('Are you sure?')) return;
  await api.delete(id);
  navigate('/list');
};
```
