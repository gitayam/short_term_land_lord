# Task CRUD Implementation - October 12, 2025

## Overview
Completed the task management system by adding update and delete functionality. Tasks now have full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

**Live URL:** https://dfff6fbb.short-term-landlord.pages.dev

## ✅ What Was Added

### Backend APIs (NEW)
**File:** `functions/api/tasks/[id].ts` (222 lines, created)

**Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/tasks/[id]` - Get single task with property info
- `PUT /api/tasks/[id]` - Update task (all fields optional)
- `DELETE /api/tasks/[id]` - Delete task

**Features:**
- Ownership verification (only task creator can modify)
- Dynamic update query (only updates provided fields)
- Property join for task details
- Proper error handling and status codes
- Authorization checks

**Update Fields Supported:**
- title
- description
- status (PENDING, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, CANCELLED)
- priority (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, URGENT)
- property_id (can be null)
- due_date (can be null)

---

### API Service Updates
**File:** `src/services/api.ts` (modified)

**Added Methods:**
```typescript
tasksApi.get(id: string)          // Fetch single task
tasksApi.update(id, data)         // Update task
tasksApi.delete(id)               // Delete task
```

**Before:**
- ✅ list() - List tasks with filters
- ✅ create() - Create new task
- ❌ get() - Missing
- ❌ update() - Missing
- ❌ delete() - Missing

**After:**
- ✅ list() - List tasks with filters
- ✅ create() - Create new task
- ✅ get() - Fetch single task
- ✅ update() - Update task
- ✅ delete() - Delete task

---

### Frontend Implementation
**File:** `src/pages/tasks/TasksPage.tsx` (modified)

**New State:**
```typescript
const [editingTask, setEditingTask] = useState<Task | null>(null);
```

**New Handlers:**
```typescript
handleEditTask(task)           // Open edit form with task data
handleUpdateTask(e)            // Submit task update
handleDeleteTask(id, title)    // Delete with confirmation
handleCancelEdit()             // Cancel edit mode
```

**UI Changes:**

1. **Dual-Mode Form:**
   - Create mode: Empty form for new tasks
   - Edit mode: Pre-populated form for existing tasks
   - Form title changes dynamically
   - Submit button text changes (Create/Update)

2. **Task List Actions:**
   - Replaced "View" button with "Edit" and "Delete" buttons
   - Edit button opens form with task data
   - Delete button shows confirmation dialog
   - Buttons styled consistently with rest of app

3. **Form State Management:**
   - Form clears after successful create/update
   - Edit cancellation returns to list view
   - Add Task button closes edit form if open
   - No conflicts between create and edit modes

## 🔄 User Flow

### Edit Task Flow
1. User clicks "Edit" button on a task
2. Form opens with task data pre-populated
3. User modifies fields
4. User clicks "Update Task"
5. API call updates task
6. Form closes
7. Task list refreshes with updated data

### Delete Task Flow
1. User clicks "Delete" button on a task
2. Confirmation dialog appears: "Are you sure you want to delete [Task Title]?"
3. User confirms or cancels
4. If confirmed: API call deletes task
5. Task list refreshes without deleted task

### Create Task Flow (No Changes)
1. User clicks "+ Add Task"
2. Empty form appears
3. User fills in fields
4. User clicks "Create Task"
5. API call creates task
6. Form closes
7. Task list refreshes with new task

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

### Before
- ❌ No way to edit tasks after creation
- ❌ No way to delete tasks
- ❌ "View" button did nothing
- ❌ Had to delete via database or API manually

### After
- ✅ Edit button opens pre-filled form
- ✅ Delete button with confirmation
- ✅ Clear visual distinction (Edit/Delete buttons)
- ✅ All operations from UI

### Button Design
```tsx
// Edit button - subtle secondary style
<button className="px-3 py-1 border border-gray-300 rounded-lg hover:bg-gray-50 text-sm">
  Edit
</button>

// Delete button - prominent red warning style
<button className="px-3 py-1 bg-red-600 text-white rounded-lg hover:bg-red-700 text-sm">
  Delete
</button>
```

## 🔒 Security

### Authorization
- All endpoints require authentication
- Ownership verification before any operation:
  ```sql
  SELECT id FROM task
  WHERE id = ? AND creator_id = ?
  ```
- Users can only modify their own tasks
- 404 response if task not found or access denied

### Input Validation
- Title required for creation (frontend validation)
- All other fields optional
- Empty/null values properly handled
- SQL injection prevented by parameterized queries

### Confirmation Dialog
- Delete operations require explicit confirmation
- Shows task title in confirmation message
- Prevents accidental deletions

## 📦 Bundle Impact

**Before:** 471.62 KB (133.41 KB gzip)
**After:** 472.80 KB (133.63 KB gzip)

**Change:** +1.18 KB (+0.22 KB gzip)

Minimal impact - only added handlers and UI logic, no new dependencies.

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Backend API Testing
- ⏳ GET /api/tasks/[id] returns task
- ⏳ PUT /api/tasks/[id] updates task
- ⏳ DELETE /api/tasks/[id] removes task
- ⏳ Authorization prevents unauthorized access
- ⏳ 404 for non-existent tasks
- ⏳ Dynamic updates (partial field updates)

### Frontend Testing
- ⏳ Click Edit button opens form with task data
- ⏳ Edit form pre-populates all fields correctly
- ⏳ Submit edit form updates task
- ⏳ Cancel edit returns to list view
- ⏳ Click Delete shows confirmation dialog
- ⏳ Confirm delete removes task
- ⏳ Cancel delete keeps task
- ⏳ Create and Edit modes don't conflict
- ⏳ All fields update correctly (title, description, status, priority, property, due_date)
- ⏳ Form validation works in edit mode

### Edge Cases
- ⏳ Edit task, then click "Add Task" - should close edit
- ⏳ Create task, then edit another - should work
- ⏳ Delete last task - should show empty state
- ⏳ Edit task with no property - should allow null
- ⏳ Edit task with no due date - should allow null

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **No Inline Editing:** Must open form to edit
2. **No Bulk Operations:** Can't delete multiple tasks at once
3. **No Undo:** Deleted tasks cannot be recovered
4. **Alert Dialogs:** Using browser confirm() instead of custom modal
5. **No Loading States:** No spinners during update/delete operations

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

### Short Term
1. **Loading indicators** during API calls
2. **Toast notifications** instead of alerts
3. **Success messages** after operations
4. **Error details** in user-friendly format
5. **Inline status updates** (click to change status without form)

### Medium Term
1. **Task detail modal** - View full task without editing
2. **Bulk operations** - Select and delete multiple tasks
3. **Task history** - Track changes over time
4. **Task comments** - Add notes to tasks
5. **Task attachments** - Upload files

### Long Term
1. **Task templates** - Save common task configurations
2. **Recurring tasks** - Automatically create tasks on schedule
3. **Task dependencies** - Link related tasks
4. **Task notifications** - Email/SMS reminders
5. **Task assignments** - Assign to team members

## 📝 Code Patterns

### Dynamic Update Query
```typescript
// Build update query dynamically
const updates: string[] = [];
const params: any[] = [];

if (data.title !== undefined) {
  updates.push('title = ?');
  params.push(data.title);
}
// ... more fields

params.push(taskId);

await env.DB.prepare(
  `UPDATE task SET ${updates.join(', ')} WHERE id = ?`
).bind(...params).run();
```

This pattern:
- Only updates fields that are provided
- Prevents overwriting with null/undefined
- Flexible for partial updates
- Used in properties API too

### Edit State Management
```typescript
const handleEditTask = (task: Task) => {
  setEditingTask(task);          // Store task being edited
  setFormData(task);              // Pre-fill form
  setShowCreateForm(false);       // Close create form if open
};

const handleCancelEdit = () => {
  setEditingTask(null);           // Clear edit state
  setFormData(initialState);      // Reset form
};
```

This pattern:
- Prevents mode conflicts
- Clear state transitions
- Reusable form component
