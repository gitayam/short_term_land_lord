```json
{
  "success": true,
  "events": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "title": "Booking",
      "start_date": "2025-10-15",
      "end_date": "2025-10-18",

      "platform_name": "Airbnb"
    }
  ],
  "count": 1,
  "cached": false
}
```

**API Features:**
- KV caching (5-minute TTL)

## 🎨 UI/UX Design

### Color Coding Strategy
Events are color-coded by status for quick visual scanning:
- **Confirmed** (green): Ready bookings, no action needed
- **Pending** (yellow): Awaiting confirmation
- **Cancelled** (red): Cancelled bookings
- **Blocked** (gray): Owner-blocked dates
- **Other** (blue): Default/unspecified

### Layout
- Fixed 700px height for calendar
- Responsive grid adjusts to screen size
- Event blocks show guest name + platform
- Tooltips on hover with additional info
- Legend at bottom for reference

### Empty States
1. **No Properties**: Clear CTA to add property
2. **No Selection**: Instruction to select from dropdown
3. **No Events**: Message about calendar syncing

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Performed ✅
- ✅ Build succeeds without errors
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Deployment to Cloudflare Pages successful

### Recommended Testing (User)
- ⏳ Navigate to /calendar
- ⏳ Verify property dropdown appears
- ⏳ Select different properties
- ⏳ Verify calendar loads events
- ⏳ Click on an event
- ⏳ Verify modal shows correct details
- ⏳ Close modal
- ⏳ Test month/week/day view switching
- ⏳ Test date navigation (prev/next month)
- ⏳ Test with property that has no events
- ⏳ Test with multiple overlapping bookings
- ⏳ Verify color coding matches booking status
- ⏳ Test URL parameter (?property=123)

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Optional)
1. **Add date range selector** - Filter events by custom date range
2. **Add calendar sync button** - Manual sync with external platforms
3. **Add event creation** - Create manual bookings/blocks
4. **Add quick actions** - Actions from event modal (edit, cancel, etc.)

### Future Enhancements
1. **Multiple property view** - Show all properties on one calendar
2. **Drag-and-drop** - Move bookings between dates
3. **Export** - Export calendar to iCal format
4. **Print view** - Printer-friendly calendar view
5. **Recurring events** - Support for recurring bookings
6. **Availability overlay** - Show available vs booked dates

---

## 📝 Known Limitations

1. **Property Required**: Must have at least one property to use calendar
2. **No Manual Events**: Cannot create events directly from calendar (must sync from platforms)
3. **Single Property View**: Can only view one property at a time
4. **No Filtering**: Cannot filter by booking status or date range (shows all)
5. **No Editing**: Cannot edit events from calendar view
6. **Bundle Size**: Large bundle due to calendar library (acceptable trade-off)

---

## 🐛 Potential Issues

### If Calendar Doesn't Load
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify API endpoint responds: `GET /api/calendar/events?property_id=X`
3. Check that property has events in database
4. Verify user owns the selected property

### If Events Don't Display
1. Check event date format (must be valid ISO dates)
2. Verify `start_date` and `end_date` are present
3. Check calendar database table has data
4. Verify events are within visible calendar range

### Performance Issues
1. Large number of events (>100) may slow rendering
2. Consider pagination or date range limiting
3. KV caching helps with repeated requests
4. Bundle size may affect initial load on slow connections
