## ⚠️ **Risks & Mitigation**

### **Risk 1: Airbnb Retaliation**
- **Risk**: Airbnb bans owners who direct book
- **Mitigation**: Target "after first stay" guests, position as loyalty program
- **Reality**: Airbnb can't monitor off-platform communication

### **Risk 2: Payment Fraud**
- **Risk**: Chargebacks, fake bookings
- **Mitigation**: Stripe verification, security deposits, owner approval required
- **Reality**: Lower risk than Airbnb (owners choose guests)

### **Risk 3: Adoption**
- **Risk**: Owners don't use booking feature
- **Mitigation**: Make it stupidly simple, provide training, show ROI immediately
- **Reality**: Money talks - saving $150/booking is compelling

### **Risk 4: Guest Trust**
- **Risk**: Guests hesitant to book outside Airbnb
- **Mitigation**: Professional design, reviews, secure payments, clear policies
- **Reality**: Savings overcome hesitation
