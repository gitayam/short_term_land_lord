### Managing Calendars

From the "Manage Calendars" page, you can:

- Manually trigger a sync for any calendar

## Automated Calendar Sync

The system includes an automated calendar sync script that can be scheduled to run regularly to keep your bookings up to date.

### Setting Up Automated Sync

To set up automated sync, you can use a cron job (on Linux/Mac) or Task Scheduler (on Windows) to run the sync script periodically.

#### Example cron job (daily at 2 AM):

```
0 2 * * * cd /path/to/your/app && python -m app.tasks.sync_calendars >> /path/to/logs/cron.log 2>&1
```

#### Using the sync script manually:

```
python -m app.tasks.sync_calendars
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with calendar synchronization:

1. Check that the iCal URL is correct and accessible
2. Verify that the URL belongs to the correct service
3. Check the sync status and error message in the "Manage Calendars" page
4. Try manually syncing the calendar
5. Check the log files at `calendar_sync.log` if running the sync script manually
