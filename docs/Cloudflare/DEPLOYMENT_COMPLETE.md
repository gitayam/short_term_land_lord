## 🐛 Issues Resolved

### 1. Service Bindings Not Applied
**Problem**: API returned 500 errors with "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'prepare')"
**Cause**: Service bindings not configured in Cloudflare Dashboard
**Solution**: Manually configured D1, KV, and R2 bindings in production environment
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

### 2. Role Authorization 403 Errors
**Problem**: Dashboard returned 403 "Access denied" after login
**Cause**: Admin user had role `'owner'` but code checked for `'admin'`
