   - Provide password reset option

### User Impact Risks
1. **Learning Curve for New UI**
   - Mitigation: Maintain similar UI/UX patterns
   - Provide user guide
   - Offer training sessions

2. **Downtime During Cutover**
   - Mitigation: Perform cutover during low-traffic hours
   - Use gradual traffic shift
   - Communicate timeline to users
