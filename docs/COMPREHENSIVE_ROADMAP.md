---

## 🔧 Technical Debt

### High Priority
1. **Add toast notifications** - Replace browser `alert()` calls
2. **Form validation** - Add comprehensive client-side validation
3. **Error boundaries** - Add React error boundaries
4. **Loading states** - Improve loading UX
5. **Tests** - Add unit and integration tests

### Medium Priority
1. **Image optimization** - Implement lazy loading
2. **Bundle splitting** - Code splitting for routes
3. **Caching strategy** - Better use of KV caching
4. **Accessibility** - ARIA labels, keyboard navigation
5. **Mobile optimization** - Better responsive design

### Low Priority
1. **Documentation** - API documentation
2. **Storybook** - Component library
3. **E2E tests** - Playwright/Cypress tests
4. **Performance monitoring** - Add observability

---

## 📝 Notes

### Key Decisions
1. **No Modal Libraries:** Using inline forms for simplicity
2. **API-First:** All features have backend APIs first
3. **Incremental Migration:** Migrating from Flask piece by piece
4. **Edge-First:** Leveraging Cloudflare edge network for performance

### Lessons Learned
1. Backend APIs were already complete - focus was needed on frontend
2. Inline forms work well for CRUD operations
3. Property linking is important for all features (tasks, inventory, etc.)
4. Confirmation dialogs are critical for delete operations
5. Calendar needs a dedicated library - too complex to build from scratch
