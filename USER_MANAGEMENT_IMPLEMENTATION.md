## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### Database Changes
```sql
-- New Tables Created
CREATE TABLE user_notes (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    admin_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    note_type VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'general',
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    is_important BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE user_account_actions (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    admin_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    action_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    old_value VARCHAR(255),
    new_value VARCHAR(255),
    reason TEXT,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### New Admin Routes Added
- `GET /admin/users/<id>/details` - Get comprehensive user details

- `POST /admin/users/<id>/add-note` - Add admin note
- `POST /admin/users/<id>/notes/<note_id>/delete` - Delete note
- `GET /admin/user-roles` - Get available user roles

### Enhanced User Model Methods
```python
# Admin management methods added to User model
def disable_account(self, admin_user, reason=None)
def enable_account(self, admin_user, reason=None)
def change_role(self, new_role, admin_user, reason=None)
def reset_password_admin(self, admin_user, new_password, reason=None)
def add_admin_note(self, admin_user, content, note_type='general', is_important=False)
def get_recent_notes(self, limit=10)
def get_recent_actions(self, limit=10)
