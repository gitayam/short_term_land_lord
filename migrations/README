MIGRATIONS DIRECTORY
===================

This directory contains database migration scripts and utilities needed for maintaining and updating the database schema. It includes both Alembic-based Flask migrations and custom database fix scripts.

Key files:
- run_db_fixes.sh: Main script to prepare and fix the database (run during app startup)
- install_requirements.sh: Script to install required Python packages
- startup.py: Script to fix any PostgreSQL transaction issues before app starts
- reset_db.py: Script to create database tables directly if migrations fail
- versions/: Directory containing Alembic migration versions

When the app starts in Docker, these scripts are executed as part of the startup sequence.
