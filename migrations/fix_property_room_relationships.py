"""
Migration script to fix the relationship between Property and Room models.

This script:
1. Checks if the Property-Room relationship has duplicates
2. Makes a direct SQL fix for SQLAlchemy to recognize the correct relationship

The issue is that the Property model has duplicate relationships to the Room model:
- property_rooms = db.relationship('Room', backref='property')
- rooms = db.relationship('Room', backref='property_parent', overlaps="property,property_rooms")

This causes confusion in the ORM with overlapping backrefs. This script ensures only one
relationship is used consistently.

Usage:
    python fix_property_room_relationships.py
