## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Docker and Docker Compose (recommended)
- If not using Docker, you will need Python 3.9+ and PostgreSQL
- For production deployment: Google Cloud SDK

### Docker Setup (Recommended)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gitayam/short_term_land_lord.git
   cd short_term_land_lord
   ```

2. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   nano .env
   ```

3. Configure your environment variables in `.env`:
   ```
   FLASK_APP=app.py
   FLASK_ENV=development
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@db:5432/stll_db
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   ```

4. Build and start the containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```

5. Access the application at http://localhost:5001

### Local Installation (Alternative)

1. Clone the repository and create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gitayam/short_term_land_lord.git
   cd short_term_land_lord
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure your environment (see Docker setup step 2-3)

4. Initialize the database:
   ```bash
   flask db upgrade
   ```

5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

## Production Deployment üöÄ

### Google App Engine Deployment

The application is configured for deployment to Google App Engine as a separate service.

1. **Setup Google Cloud SDK**:
   ```bash
   gcloud auth login
   gcloud config set project your-project-id
   ```

2. **Configure Secrets**:
   ```bash
   # Store application secrets in Google Cloud Secret Manager
   gcloud secrets create landlord-app-secrets --data-file=secrets.json
   ```

3. **Deploy to App Engine**:
   ```bash
   gcloud app deploy app_simple.yaml --project=your-project --version=production
   ```

### Production Configuration

The application uses different configurations for production:

- **Database**: SQLite with startup initialization (ephemeral but auto-recreating)
- **Caching**: Redis-based caching for performance
- **Sessions**: Secure session management
- **Logging**: Structured JSON logging with request correlation
- **Monitoring**: Health checks available at `/health` endpoint

### Debug Features

For troubleshooting production issues:

- `/debug-admin`: Check admin user status and password validation
- `/recreate-admin`: Force recreate admin user if needed
- Structured logging for error tracking

## Development Workflow

### Database Management

The application uses PostgreSQL and follows these practices:

- Development environment uses Docker volumes for persistence
- Database can be reset using: `docker-compose down --volumes && docker-compose up -d`
- Migrations are stored in the `migrations/` directory
- New migrations can be created with: `flask db migrate -m "Description"`
- Apply migrations with: `flask db upgrade`

### Running Tests

```bash
# Ensure your virtual environment is activated
python3 -m pytest tests/
```
